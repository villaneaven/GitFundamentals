Hello, my name is Heaven. This is my first git markdown file!

Things I want to learn are:

- How to make a simple website.
- Programming with Ruby.
- How to use all of GitHub's features.

| What have I learned?      | From the reading, I learned how to clone a repository to my local machine. I cloned a repository to Visual Studio Code and used markdown syntax to make a text file. I also learned how to commit changes and push them to the github repository. |
| What am I confused about? | I don't know enough to know what I am confused about, but right now I'm having trouble understanding what branches in GitHub do.                                                                                                                  |
